## Getting Started

#### 1) Create Local Environment File

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

At a minimum, the following .env variables need to be updated for the app to sucessfully run.

- `DATABASE_URL`
  - Follow the "Set up Database" step below to get this.
- `BC_STORE_HASH`, `BC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `BC_CHANNEL_ID`, and `BC_GQL_URL`
  - Follow the BigCommerce setup instructions below to get these.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - Follow the Stripe setup instructions below to get these.

#### 2) Install App Dependencies

_We recommend using node v14.17.0_

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3) Set up Database

This app works with MongoDB. The `provider` setting in the `/prisma/schema.prisma` should be set to `mongodb`. We highly recommend using MongoDB, but if you would like to use another type of database, you will need to udpate the configuration to work with the database of your choice. View the available database options here: https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources/)

Update the `DATABASE_URL` var in `/prisma/.env` to match your new DB connection string generated from Mongo Cloud ( https://cloud.mongodb.com ).

1. Click [here](https://account.mongodb.com/) and log in there, if you dont have an account you can click [SignUp](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)

5. From there click on "ADD IP ADDRESS" and in popup modal click on "ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS" button

6. Then click `Database` on left hand sidebar, which opens the first page when you logged in

7. And Click "Connect" button in your running cluster

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97689831/162502486-91dc1545-ea98-45db-844c-9b6fa5e9de1e.png)

8. Then Click "Connect your application" button in the popup modal

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97689831/162502592-b89a0ec7-e60f-4184-9b39-db836404c129.png)

9. Then you can see MongoDB connection string in 2nd section, replace <username> and <password> with one of the user you created in 3rd step and just copy it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97689831/162502665-6bb82bc6-9557-428b-a8e8-3cac7dd56bdb.png)

That's your MongoDB connection string which you should use as `DATABASE_URL` in .env

</details>

Once your Mongo Cloud account is setup, you are going to want to create the database in your new Mongo Cloud account and seed it with data:

```
  $ npx prisma db push

  $ npm run seed
```

Then you need to generate a new prisma client using your database provider settings.

```
  $ npx prisma generate
```

_Note: `npx prisma generate` is what creates the DB tables and initial client. If you miss this step, you'll see errors about prisma missing._

Now you'll be able to access this database locally via a visual editor and verify the table have been created.

```
  $ npx prisma studio
```

You can also use Mongo Compass as your database GUI. Download and install to connect: [Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

#### 4) Run App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, the app will be running locally!

Login as an admin role here: http://localhost:3000/signin (the default admin PIN in the seed data is: 1234)

Once logged in, navigate to the Settings screen to save your store address. This is the address that will be used for your checkout tax calculations.

## BigCommerce Setup

1. Create BigCommerce store: go to [https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/?source=pos-foundation) and signup for a free trial if you don't have one

2. The Bigcommerce store you are connected to must have "Pickup in Store" as a shipping option for orders to be created on the POS. Go to "Store Setup -> Shipping" in your admin to turn it on.

3. Create BigCommerce v2/v3 API credentials. Go to Advanced Settings > API Accounts and create and API Account with these scopes:

```
Customers: MODIFY
Information & settings: READ-ONLY
Orders: MODIFY
Create payments: CREATE
Get payment methods: READ-ONLY
Products: READ-ONLY
Carts: MODIFY
Checkouts: MODIFY
Channel Settings: MODIFY
Storefront API tokens: MANAGE
```

## Stripe Setup

1. Go to your Stripe dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers
2. Copy the Stripe secret key and add to your .env file
3. Go to 'More > Terminal' in the dashboard. Press 'Get Started' when asked to activate the Terminal section.
4. Add a location, then click on the location row to manage details.
5. Add a new reader to the location.

## Connecting to a reader in the POS

When on the main register screen, press the 'wifi' icon, which will read all of your terminals from Stripe and check if they are active on your network.

Press 'Connect' for the active terminal you'd like to use to take payment at checkout.

## Key areas of codebase

- `/backend`
  - Where the auth and various API services live. These are uses within the internal API endpoints to keep routes secure and reach out to external APIs.
- `/prisma`
  - Where the DB models and initial seed data lives. Prisma uses this to generate DB clients for the app.
- `/shared`
  - Where the types are located.
- `/src/pages`
  - Where the sections of the app are managed.
  - Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages
- `/src/pages/api`
  - Where the APIs for the app are managed.
  - Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
- `/src/providers`
  - Where the context providers used within pages and components live.
  - Most are built using the concept of an 'ActionBuilder' that manages execution, loading status, and data setting in a consistent manner.
    - `/{provider}/context.ts`: The types used througout the provider
    - `/{provider}/index.ts`: The actions available to the pages and components using the context providers
    - `/{provider}/ methods.ts`: The functions used within the actions to fetch / modify data
